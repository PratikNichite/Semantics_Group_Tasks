# üìù **Text & Dialogue Summarizer**
 - In our project we use different models such as BART, T5, Pegasus and Tuner-Pegasus. In all of these, BART model outperformed all the other model. Therefore we use BART model for our project.
 - We trained the Facebook BART model further on `SAMSum` dataset from Hugging Faceü§ó.
 - Our model is used for dialogue and paragraph summariation.
 - This model is then uploaded on Hugging Face platform ( [link](https://huggingface.co/pratiknichite/TrainedTextSummerizerBART) ) and being used through the API, in this project.
 - The deployed version can be viewed at https://dialogue-summarizer-pratik-nichite.vercel.app.
