# üìù**Text Summarizer**
 - In text summarization, the Facebook BART Large CNN model is a valuable tool for simplifying lengthy text.
 - This model, developed by Facebook, has been fine-tuned on the CNN news dataset, making it particularly effective at summarization.
 - By leveraging the Hugging Face Transformers library and its pipeline API, developers can easily access and use this model for text summarization tasks.
 - We train the model on `samsum` dataset from Hugging Face for dialogue summariation.
