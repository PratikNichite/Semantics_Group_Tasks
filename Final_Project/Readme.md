# üìù **Text Summarizer**
 - In text summarization, the Facebook BART Large CNN model is a valuable tool for simplifying lengthy text.
 - This model, developed by Facebook, has been fine-tuned on the CNN news dataset, making it particularly effective at summarization.
  - We trained the Facebook BART model further on `SAMSum` dataset from Hugging Face for dialogue summariation.
 - This model is then uploaded on Hugging Face platform ([link](https://huggingface.co/pratiknichite/TrainedTextSummerizerBART))and being used through the API, in this project.
 - The deployed version can be viewed at https://dialogue-summarizer-pratik-nichite.vercel.app/.
